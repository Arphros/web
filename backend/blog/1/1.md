As you know that our old website is not good and full of bugs, so we decided to create a new one.
This new website is create with [Svelte kit](https://kit.svelte.dev) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) framework. 
<br><br>
It's opensource, and you can use it for free! Under license Apache 2.0.  
Fork me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Arphros/web)!
<br><br>
APIs are not ready for production yet. And some features are not present yet.  
But what changes from the old website?
<br><br>
Well, we have a new design, we have a new system, and we have a new database!  
Here is some examples of what we have changed:

## Homepage

... and more!
